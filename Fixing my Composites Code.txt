Fixing my Composites Code: 

- use analytical/numerical solutions for max stress and Tsai-Wu

- figure out how to solve max stress numerically. I think my code is wrong.

- Tsai-Wu can be solved analytically. Use quadratic equation solution. Maybe derive the quadratic form of Tsai-Wu in terms of P using Mathematica?
